The proliferation of Internet usage has resulted in huge amounts of information being made available online. We instinctively trust our closest friends or relatives, or information presented to us by people in our networks[2]. The fact that there is so much information, often with rumours or inconsistencies makes it hard to know who or which information source to trust, or much worse makes it hard to not trust information that we believe come from a reliable source.\\*\\*
This thesis looks at identifying trust metrics for online social media, particularly in the case of Twitter. We look at the characteristics of trustworthy and untrustworthy tweets for example the length of tweet, the amount of retweets, followers etc and learn patterns from this to create a model which determines if a tweet is trustworthy or not.
We compare the results obtained from two different models, based on two machine learning techniques.
